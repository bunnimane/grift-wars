    ‚Ä¢ AFTER 9 rounds (IF NO TIES), there will be 
      ONE faction left. THIS IS THE CHOSEN FACTION
      WHO WILL HAVE ONE FINAL VOTE ON WHICH % OF
      THE SWEEP POOL GOES TO EACH MILADY/DERIV
      COLLECTION TO SWEEP.

    ‚ÑπÔ∏è - For a player who wants to vote every round,
          this will cost UP TO (0.036Œû + 0.005Œû)
                = 0.041Œû per rogue.

    /// -------------------------------------
    /// ‚úîÔ∏è SWEEP POOL - Phase 3
    /// ------------------------------------- 

    The SWEEP POOL consists of 67% of the total 
    Ether collected from VOTING. The other 33%
    is transferred to the development team.

    THEORETICAL SWEEP POOL:

     9                   
    ___           
    ‚ï≤     
    ‚ï±   (0.004 + 0.0002*n)*(10000-1000*n) ~= 253Œû
    ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ        
    i = 0                 

    OR

    sum((0.004 + 0.0002*n)*(10000-1000*n)) where n=0 to 9 ~= 253Œû

    = 253Œû * 0.67 ~= 169Œû

    -> TOTAL MAX POSSIBLE SWEEP POOL IS APPROX 169Œû

    ‚ÑπÔ∏è - In reality it will likely be much lower since
        many tokens will not vote every single round. 

    ‚ÑπÔ∏è - This means each remaining remilio64 has a max buying 
        power around ~0.169Œû. This would make it about a ~4x 
        from a 0.041 cost to fully play or a ~35x from player 
        who just mints at avg cost.

    /// -------------------------------------
    /// üßπ THE SWEEP - Phase 4
    /// ------------------------------------- 

    After 9 round of voting, there will be one
    faction left that's responsible to vote* on 
    this FINAL PROPOSAL. The options of the
    final proposal will be between the following 
    collections:

        - Milady Maker
        - Redacted Remilio Babies
        - Pixelady Maker
        - Ghiblady
        - Milady Station
        - Radbros
    
    *This vote will be free (minus cost of gas).

    *************************************************
    *             ! !  IMPORTANT ! !                *
    *************************************************
    **   IF A ROGUE IS TRADED AFTER IT HAS VOTED   **
    **  IT'S VOTE WILL BE RESET AND THE NEW OWNER  **
    **      WILL BE ABLE TO PLACE A NEW VOTE.      **
    *************************************************

    The percentage of votes for any option will directly
    map to the percentage of the SWEEP POOL used to 
    sweep that collection. This means multiple collections
    will be sweeped with various amounts of ether from
    the SWEEP POOL.

    Example: final votes look as follows

        - Milady Maker - 5%
        - RRB          - 30%
        - PL           - 10%
        - Ghiblady     - 10%
        - Milady Sta   - 20%
        - Radbros      - 25%

    And if the sweep pool is the theoretical max of ~169Œû. 
    This means each the above collections will get swept 
    with:

        - Milady Maker - 8.45Œû
        - RRB          - 50Œû
        - PL           - 16.9Œû
        - Ghiblady     - 16.9Œû
        - Milady Sta   - 33.8Œû
        - Radbros      - 42.25Œû


    The NFT's that are swept will be locked in the contract
    account and unable to go back into circulation. So 
    effectively sweep floor + perma lock supply. Proof by tx
    ofc.


    /// -------------------------------------
    /// üòµ TLDR
    /// ------------------------------------- 

    - Voting component for Remilio64 to eliminate
      Remilio64 factions and decide which faction
      gets final say on SWEEP POOL.
    - Voting eligible only for factions still alive.
    - Voting costs ether that goes to SWEEP POOL.
    - Last faction alive get's to vote to designate
      which milady or deriv collection is worthy
      of being swept by 67% of the SWEEP POOL.

    - SWEPT NFTS will lock supply permanently of that 
      collection.

    - Highly gamified trading of Remilio64 to get
      eligible voters, and to eventually designate
      which collections get swept.

    - On chain performance art for the remiliaverse.

    YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PLAY, YOU CAN SIMPLY COLLECT A
